Thank you, Donny. 
Oh, the usual. I bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback. 
That's a great plan, Walter. That's fuckin' ingenious, if I understand it correctly. It's a Swiss fuckin' watch. 
He fixes the cable? 
Fuck sympathy! I don't need your fuckin' sympathy, man, I need my fucking johnson! 
God damn you Walter! You fuckin' asshole! Everything's a fuckin' travesty with you, man! And what was all that shit about Vietnam? What the FUCK, has anything got to do with Vietnam? What the fuck are you talking about? 
Yeah, but Walter... 
Walter... what am I going to tell Lebowski? 
Walter... 
Walter... 
Who gives a shit! They're gonna kill that poor woman, man! What am I gonna tell Lebowski? 
Yeah, and in the meantime, what do I tell Lebowski? 
Walter, how am I going to... 
Oh fuck it. I'm out of here. 
Will you come off it, Walter? You're not even fucking Jewish, man. 
Man, you're fucking Polish Catholic... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... 
Yeah, and five fucking years ago you were divorced. 
It's all a part of your sick Cynthia thing, man. Taking care of her fucking dog. Going to her fucking synagogue. You're living in the fucking past. 
Also, my rug was stolen. 
No. It was here. 
These are, uh... 
Different mothers, huh? 
Racially he's pretty cool? 
Obviously you're not a golfer. 
Walter, what is the point? Look, we all know who is at fault here, what the fuck are you talking about? 
My rug. 
Walter, the chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill, so what the fuck are you talking about? 
Walter, this isn't a guy who built the railroads here. This is a guy... 
Walter, he peed on my rug! 
Look, just stay away from my fucking lady friend. 
She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend. I'm just helping her conceive, man! 
Well, they finally did it. They killed my fucking car. 
You don't HAVE the fucking girl, dipshits! We know you never did! 
Hey, cool it Walter. 
Hey, cool it Walter. Look, pal, there never was any money. The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, so take it up with him, man. 
Where's the fucking money Lebowski? 
[repeated line by The Dude and others] That rug really tied the room together. 
Who the fuck are the Knutsens? 
Walter, ya know, it's Smokey, so his toe slipped over the line a little, big deal. It's just a game, man. 
Walter... 
They're calling the cops, put the piece away. 
Walter... 
Dude. 
Dude. The bag man, man. Where do you want us to go? 
[to Walter] Shit! 
Uh. Yeah, uh. Me and, uh, the driver. I'm not handling the money, driving the car and talking on the phone all at the same time. 
That is the driver. 
Shit! Walter, you fuck... you fucked it up! You fucked it up! Her life was in our hands, man! 
It's like what Lenin said... you look for the person who will benefit, and, uh, uh... 
You know what I'm trying to say... 
Oh yeah! 
Hey, careful, man, there's a beverage here! 
And, you know, he's got emotional problems, man. 
Fuckin' Quintana... that creep can roll, man. 
Yeah. 
Oh! 
Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man. 
Jesus. 
Mind if I do a J? 
Uzi? 
What's in the fuckin' carrier? 
You brought the fuckin' Pomeranian bowling? 
Man, if my fuckin' ex-wife asked me to take care of her fuckin' dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu I'd tell her to go fuck herself. 
Jesus, man, can you change the station? 
I've had a... 
...had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man 
I mean we totally fucked it up man, we fucked up this payoff, we got the kidnappers all mad at us, and Lebowski, ya know, he yelled at me a lot but he didn't do anything, huh? 
No, I'm saying, if he knows I'm a fuck-up, why does he leave me in charge of getting his wife back? Because he doesn't fucking want her back! He no longer digs her, it's all a show! Ok, so then why doesn't he give a shit about his million bucks? I mean, he knows we never handed off the briefcase, but he never asked for it back. The million bucks was never in the briefcase! The asshole was hoping that they would kill her! You threw out a ringer for a ringer! 
Fuck the tournament... Fuck YOU, Walter! 
Jesus, man, could you change the channel? 
I had a rough... 
Come on, man. I had a rough night and I hate the fuckin' Eagles, man! 
Fuckin' A, man. I got a rash, man. 
Nobody calls me Lebowski. You got the wrong guy. I'm the Dude, man. 
My... my wi-, my wife, Bunny? Do you see a wedding ring on my finger? Does this place look like I'm fucking married? The toilet seat's up, man! 
Why me, man? 
He thinks the carpet pissers did this? 
Yeah, well. The Dude abides. 
Did you ever hear of "The Seattle Seven"? 
That was me... and six other guys. 
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose. 
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter. 
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection. 
And what's that? 
What the fuck you talking about? 
This is a very complicated case, Maude. You know, a lotta ins, a lotta outs, a lotta what-have-yous. And, uh, a lotta strands to keep in my head, man. Lotta strands in old Duder's head. 
Yeah well, I still jerk off manually. 
Uh, I'm just gonna go find a cash machine. 
Uh, is that what this is a picture of? 
Oh yeah? 
Johnson? 
'Scuse me? 
I was talking about my rug. 
You mean coitus? 
Walter... 
(interrupting) Walter, Walter, what's the point, man? 
I dropped off the money exactly as per... look, man, I've got certain information, all right? Certain things have come to light. And, you know, has it ever occurred to you, that, instead of, uh, you know, running around, uh, uh, blaming me, you know, given the nature of all this new shit, you know, I-I-I-I... this could be a-a-a-a lot more, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, complex, I mean, it's not just, it might not be just such a simple... uh, you know? 
I'll tell you what I'm blathering about... I've got information man! New shit has come to light! And shit... man, she kidnapped herself. Well sure, man. Look at it... a young trophy wife, in the parlance of our times, you know, and she, uh, uh, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers, and that's cool... that's, that's cool, I'm, I'm saying, she needs money, man. And of course they're going to say that they didn't get it, because... she wants more, man! She's got to feed the monkey, I mean uh... hasn't that ever occurred to you, man? Sir? 
Oh, Jesus, what's that smell, man? 
You thought that Bunny had been kidnapped and you were fuckin' glad, man. You could use it as an excuse to make some money disappear. All you needed was a sap to pin it on! You'd just met me! You human... paraquat! You figured 'Oh, here's a loser', you know? A deadbeat, someone the square community won't give a shit about. 
Well, yeah! 
Do you find them much, these, stolen cars? 
What about the toe? 
It's uh... uh... it's down there somewhere, let me take another look. 
Let me explain something to you. Um, I am not "Mr. Lebowski". You're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude. So that's what you call me. You know, that or, uh, His Dudeness, or uh, Duder, or El Duderino if you're not into the whole brevity thing. 
No you're not wrong. 
You're not wrong Walter. You're just an asshole. 
My only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off. 
Walter? 
Our car, Walter? 
You don't know, Walter? 
You fucking know its been stolen. 
Oh fuck it. 
I'm going home, Donny. 
Thank you, Donny. 
Excuse me? 
[on the phone] Of course the car made it home, you're calling me at home. No, Walter, it did NOT look like Larry was about to crack! 
Oh boy. How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm once they've seen Karl Hungus. 
Oh, uh, yeah, uh... a tape deck, some Creedence tapes, and there was a, uh... uh, my briefcase. 
Uh, uh, papers, um, just papers, uh, you know, uh, my papers, business papers. 
I'm unemployed. 
What are you, a fucking park ranger now? 
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot! 
Employed? 
Is this a... what day is this? 
I do mind, the Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this aggression will not stand, man. 
Hey, nice marmot! 
Mr. Treehorn treats objects like women, man. 
[after a pause] I'm sorry, I wasn't listening. 
You want me to blow on your toes? 
[looks at man lazing in the pool] Are you sure he won't mind? 
Ah, that must be exhausting. 
This is the fuckin' guy! I can find this fuckin' Lebowski guy! 
Yes, Walter, you're right. There is an unspoken message here. It's "FUCK YOU, LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!" Yeah, I'll be at practice. 
Who the fuck are you, man? 
Yeah, a friend with a cleft asshole? 
Beaver? Uhhhh, you mean vagina...? I mean, you know the guy? 
At least I'm housebroken. 
I'm sorry your stepmother is a nympho. 
Walter, I love you, but sooner or later, you're going to have to face the fact you're a goddamn moron. 
Just take it easy man. 
[shouting] Yeah, waving the fucking gun around? 
Will you just take it easy? 
Ah, fuck it. 
Oh, fuck me, man! That kid already spent all the money, man! 
I could be just sitting at home with pee stains on my rug. 
I only said I THOUGHT she kidnapped herself. You're the one who's so fucking certain! 
What the fuck is that supposed to mean? What the fuck are we gonna tell Lebowski? 
Well, the problem is... W-what do you mean "what's the"... umph... Th-there was no... We d- we didn't eh... uhumph... They're gonna kill that poor woman! Man! 
Man...! I said I THOUGHT she kidnapped herself... YOU'RE the one who's so fucking certain! 
Look, nothing is fucked, here, man. 
Thank you Walter, that makes me feel very secure, it makes me feel very warm inside. 
Look, man... 
Just ask him about the car. 
Is that your car out front? 
We know it's his fucking homework! Where's the fucking money, you little brat? 
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter... 
And the fucking money. 
We're going to cut your dick off, Larry. 
Then whose toe is it, Walter? 
On you maybe. 
Okay. The old man told me to take any rug in the house. 
Brother Seamus? Like an Irish monk? 
Yeah, yeah, I get it, fuck off Da Fino. And stay away from my special - from my fucking lady friend, man! 
H-hey, this is a private residence, man! 
Ah, no that was the chief of police of Malibu. A real reactionary. 
Ow! Fucking fascist! 
Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. Real fucking brat, but I'm sure your goons can get it off him. I mean, he's fifteen. 
Flunking social studies. 
So if you could just write me my check for ten percent of a half a million... five grand... I'll go out and mingle. 
Then you know he's got emotional problems, man. 
Yeah, sure, if I'm... in the neighborhood and I, uh... gotta use the john. 
By the way, do you think that you could give me that $20,000 in cash? My concern is, and I have to, uh, check with my accountant, that this might bump me into a higher, uh, tax... 
Oh, you've already got the check made out, that's great. 
Does the Pope shit in the woods? 
Oh, no I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various administration buildings... smoking a lot of thai stick... breaking into the ROTC... and bowling. To tell you the truth Brandt, I don't remember most of it. 
We dropped off the damn money... 
I! The Royal "we"! You know, the editorial... 
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my rug? 
Uh, and then, uh, the music business, briefly. 
Yeah. Roadie for Metallica 
Speed of Sound Tour 
Bunch of assholes. 
[as he sits down] Uh, yeah. White Russian? 
Dude. 
Uhh... I don't know sir. 
Hmmm... Sure, that and a pair of testicles. 
[Smoking a joint] Dude, fuckin' A! 
What do you do? 
Well, I could do that... 
[stunned] A hundred... 
Hey, no, come on, Walter. We're ending this thing cheap, man. 
Alright, alright, I've got four dollars, almost five... 
Well, I dig your style too, man. Got the whole cowboy thing goin'. 
Man, don't say that, man. 
Oh, shit, man. 
He was innocent, not a charge was true, and they say he ran away... Branded! 
They're gonna kill that poor woman. 
Walter, would you just shut the fuck... don't say a peep while I'm doing business here, man! 
Fuckin' A. 
I hate the fuckin' Eagles man. 
Oh, man, don't do that. Not on the rug, man. 
Obviously, you're not a golfer. 
...Maude? 
That's my robe. 
Mr. Treehorn treats objects like women, man. 
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers? 
Would you come off it Walter? You're not even fucking Jewish, man. 
You're fucking Polish-Catholic! 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... 
...And five fucking years ago you were divorced man! 
I'm sorry I wasn't listening, can you repeat that? 
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with - do you have any Kahlúa? 
He's fragile! 
I was one of the original authors of the Port Huron Declaration. Not the compromised second draft... 
This isn't a First Amendment issue, man. 
Thank you, Donny. 
Oh, the usual. I bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback. 
That's a great plan, Walter. That's fuckin' ingenious, if I understand it correctly. It's a Swiss fuckin' watch. 
He fixes the cable? 
Fuck sympathy! I don't need your fuckin' sympathy, man, I need my fucking johnson! 
God damn you Walter! You fuckin' asshole! Everything's a fuckin' travesty with you, man! And what was all that shit about Vietnam? What the FUCK, has anything got to do with Vietnam? What the fuck are you talking about?
