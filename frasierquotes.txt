Niles, was that Natalie Spencer I just saw you talking with? 
And? 
So I'm not crazy. 
Oh, fewer nuts, more money - something I've been aspiring to for my entire professional life! 
I bought tickets to an event which is right up their aisle. I felt so mortified just buying the tickets, I paid cash so they couldn't trace it back to me. 
Oh, good Lord! 
Oh, don't look so smug, you try skating and blowing into a jug while your heart's breaking! 
You try skating and blowing into a jug while your heart is breaking. 
Dad, there was a time after my first marriage was breaking up, I was talking to Mom. She said to me, "Frasier, you've got to promise me you're not going to give up." I said, "Mom, please, the last thing I want to hear is a bunch of clich s, and that we're all put on the earth to love each other, and how it's certainly possible for the human heart to love more than one person." I said, "Alright, Mom, give me one good reason to ever let myself fall in love again." She said, "Because I said so and I'm your mother!" 
No. 
The vain, neurotic, lying Roz? 
I have no intention in repairing the rift. God, last night for the first time in months I wasn't jolted awake at two a.m. by her rousing rendition of "Funky Mountain Breakdown"! 
Yes... 
So, for the second time in two nights Sherry manages to chase away another date! She's like a scarecrow in the cornfield of my love life! 
All right, young animal: learn from the master. Now, follow these time-honored traditions, and you too might get lucky with that young Pekinese peach you've been eyeing in the park. Now, for mood: Vivaldi. And then, for lighting: not so bright as to show the wrinkles, not so dark as to make her think you're hiding anything. And leaving nothing to chance... 
Pouily Fuisse 1992, elector a la carte. Dear God, I could teach a course! 
Oh, there's my canapés. 
You'll get a full debriefing - as, hopefully, will I. 
Niles! I'd offer you a sherry, but I'm fresh out! 
Well no, not after what happened last time. Your watchband got caught in my hair. 
Daphne, shh... do you hear that? 
The sound of a Sherry-free apartment. I've been basking in it for the last thirty minutes. Right now, I feel like a seafront village after the Vikings have left. 
"Not bad"? If I didn't know better, I'd say someone was a little jealous. After this weekend you may have to give up your dating crown. 
It's a wonder you could rotate anything after that. 
Not hardly, I wouldn't do that sort of thing. I came over here to gloat because *two* women came onto me! 
My God, I've never had a night like this in my entire life! I'm a babe magnet, I'm catnip! 
Well Niles, I'll tell you what. Seeing as how Cupid has so amply stocked my quiver this evening, I shall try and shine on your behalf. 
Not so fast, Mr. Hicks. You won't find me doing anything foolish. 
Daphne. 
Yes, you too. 
Try hauling it out of here! 
What are you doing? 
There's a hidden camera up there? 
Well Niles, it doesn't look like anybody is leaving; why don't we take a table outside? 
No, God is crying! 
Do you ask any other kind? 
Oh, just something that happened the other morning. I asked Dad to pass me a bran muffin, you know what he said to me? He said "What's the magic word?" 
He didn't think it was very amusing when I said "rest home"! 
"Wow"? Did you say "Wow"? 
Oh, absolutely. It means you're a gay man. Your life with Maris was a charade and you should have come out of the closet years ago. Are you going to tell Dad or shall I? 
So, what's new? 
How did that turn out? 
Well, good for her. Apparently it's bringing out her spiritual side. 
What is it now? 
How do you get through the day? 
Oh, I wouldn't say that's true. If it were... oh, forget it. 
I'd rather not. 
So, you really do love her? 
You mean it's not human? 
I'm told it was a lot like that near the end in the Hitler household. 
Niles, it isn't a question of liking or not liking. She despises you. 
I think you may be on to something there, Sherlock! 
A dollar-fifty. 
Oh, I tried that damn hand cream, it was so oily I couldn't get a grip on the doorknob. I waited to be rescued, finally when some guy came in I said, "Oh God, am I glad to see you." I can't even begin to describe the look he gave me. 
There it is! 
Oh well, the best thing to do is just ignore him when he gets sarcastic. Isn't that right, Niles... Niles? 
Look, why don't we just change the subject from Dad, and talk about something else. 
I agree... Are you in love with Daphne? 
That's a little frothier than I had in mind. 
Oh, I'm sorry Roz, why don't you join us? 
You think she's kidding, don't you? 
Niles! 
I suppose the situation you're in is, you'd like to stay with Maris, but you'd like to have an affair with Daphne. 
No you can't! 
Well, I asked, but it was an Olympic year. The agency was fresh out. 
Six months ago, I was living in Boston. My wife had left me, which was very painful. Then she came back to me, which was excruciating. On top of that, my practice had grown stagnant, and my social life consisted of hanging around a bar night after night. You see, I was clinging to a life that wasn't working, and I knew I had to do something, anything. So I ended the marriage once and for all, packed up my things, and moved back here to my hometown of Seattle. Go Seahawks. 
Who? 
Is there a reason you're telling me this story? 
Remind me again how it worked for Lupe, last seen with her head in the toilet. 
Dad, what do you think of that view, huh? Hey, that's the Space Needle there. 
I do. I like her from a distance. You know, the way you like the sun. Maris is like the sun. Except without the warmth. 
How was I today? 
You're a psychiatrist, you know what it's like to listen to people prattling on endlessly about their mundane lives. 
No, not Eddie! 
But he's weird! He gives me the creeps, all he does is stare at me! 
No, I'm a psychiatrist. 
It's safe with us. Well, Miss Moon, I think we've learned everything we need to about you, and a dash extra! 
My study? You expect me to give up my study, the place where I read, where I do my most profound thinking? 
I mean "burden" in its most positive sense. 
It says that? 
Oh, God, I am, aren't I? 
Have you ever had an unexpressed thought? 
Dad as dear as this piece is to you, I just don't think it goes with anything here. 
Oh, Niles... 
Niles, you know I'm right. 
I most certainly am too! 
Did it work? 
As a matter of fact, this day only comes around once every four years. Hmm... You know, it's like a free day - a gift. We should do something special - be bold. It's leap year - take a leap! 
Niles, I don't mind telling you, I'm a little bit concerned about this. Maris claps her hands; you come running? 
Oh, surely you're exaggerating. You've only been separated for three. 
You really want to sacrifice your self-respect for a roll in the hay? 
Of course not. Just don't think about sex. 
Grandma in a teddy. 
Well, I can see the unseasonable sunshine has done nothing to improve your mood. 
Alimony aside, I found it rather liberating. 
How bad do you think it is? 
You will rue the day! 
It may be an unwise man that doesn't learn from his own mistakes but it's an absolute idiot that doesn't learn from other people's. 
Hippity-bippity-boppity-bow, something and something and buttons and bows! 
East is East, and West is West and the wrong one I have chose! Let's go where you keep on wearing those- 
da-da-dahhs, and boppa dohs, things and buttons, buttons and bows! Don't bury me, uh - lovely pea, something, la-la-laaaaa! Let's all go to a... taco show, and a how I love, such and thrush, blow my nose, You look great in buttons and bows! I love you in buckskin, la da-da da-da daaaa! 
Everybody! My bones denounce, the fearful trounce, and la-la la-la Moldic rose! Ba-da Seuss, a palm caboose, and a panda hop, and pantyhose, you look buppity, buttons and bowwwws! 
"For of all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these: it might have been." 
We're back, Seattle. And in accordance with new station policy, we're going to be pandering to the lowest human instinct. In other words: "Who wants to talk about sex?" Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. 
Oh, for God's sake, I am trying to get some sleep! I asked you to keep that dog quiet, and instead you outfit him with a megaphone! In the last thirty-six hours I haven't had so much as a nap, and I've got to be back at the station by 2 A.M. 
Eddie, listen carefully. By the time this day is up, one of us is going to sleep. 
DON'T! I've had my share of women's opinions for the week, between the station's new Reich Chancellor and Roz's incessant whining! As far as I'm concerned, your entire sex can put a sock in it! 
Damn it! 
Kate, what a pleasure! 
Really? Well, thank you very much! I like to think of my show as a haven for the tempest-tossed in the maelstrom of everyday life. 
Really stunk up the airwaves with that one, didn't we? 
Well, for starters, you at Le Ralee. It's a two-week wait. 
Don't worry, Roz, we will she just moved us to break our spirit. 
Hello. 
As a matter of fact, I found it invigorating! Didn't you, Roz? Remember that woman who called in, uh, you know, with the delusions of grandeur? Couldn't understand why nobody liked her. 
Oh yes, respect is important. So is self-respect. 
Yes, but those people are usually rigid little demagogues who don't know the difference between the kind of respect that is earned and the kind of respect that is irrespective... of what others expect. 
I think I made myself clear. 
Good luck! 
Steady, Roz. She may have been able to intimidate people in other situations, but here at KACL she'll find that we are NOT a bunch of spineless twits! 
Hello, Line Two, you're on with Dr. Frasier Crane. 
Hello, Mark. I'm listening. 
Oh God, Roz, I don't think I've helped a single person tonight. 
Well, you're the one who's supposed to keep track of who's on what line! 
While Kitty laces up her leather bustier, this is Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL. All talk! All night! All naked! 
You know, one of these days, you are going to misquote someone, and I'm going land on you like a sumo wrestler. 
What's all this? 
Oh. Is that coffee cake I smell? 
Oh, for heaven's sake, Niles. You don't even know how to pack a lunch. 
What the hell was that? Was that a gunshot? 
Just getting up? Are you out of your mind? A gun just went off in here! 
Oh, I'm sorry, was I snippy? I didn't realize it was too much to ask that there not be gunplay in my living room! 
Oh, the new station manager's taking over today. She wanted to meet with all of us. 
Yes. Why? 
That's absurd. If I had trouble taking orders from a woman, Frederick would never have been conceived. 
Eddie, I believe that question was directed at you. 
You don't care? 
Hello? Oh, just a second, please. Dad, is Daphne in her room? 
For God's sake, I can yell! 
Would you hold, please? 
Niles, before you do something rash, you should consider it from all angles. 
Hello? Oh, just a second, please. Dad, is Daphne in her room? 
For God's sake, I can yell! 
Would you hold, please? 
How flattering: They've named a bar after her. 
Shouldn't you make a beeping noise when you back up like that? 
Roz wades in with the Gabor approach to psychiatry. 
Niles, be careful. Whatever you do, don't engage him in a physical fight. The whole thing would just look too weird! 
Let's serve our guests their coffee! 
Here we are, coffee. Milk's on its way; Niles is still steaming. 
Yes well, as I said to you the time you tried to jump out of the treehouse with an umbrella, "I suppose you know what you're doing." 
You do have a wonderful new woman in your life now, don't you? 
And Adelle does make you very happy, doesn't she? 
Well, then, if you've ever taken any of my advice before, take this: Adelle could very well be the path to your happiness. 
But let's just say I'm wrong. 
Roz, I'm going to tell you something that I didn't learn until I became a father. You don't just love your children. You fall in love with them. 
Morning, Roz! 
Oh, I realize it must be a shock to see me here in this place I come to every day of my life. 
Hey, Dad, what are you doing here? 
I think they call them "bras" now. 
Yes, I noticed. 
Unbelievable! 
I'll talk to him again. 
Yes, of course. Just remember the baby's future, Roz. Try to make it look like an accident. 
You get to share your life with a remarkable little creature... who only lives in the present, runs around naked without the slightest bit of shame, and can entertain himself for hours just staring at a shiny object. Isn't that wonderful? 
Talk to me. 
Yes. But it's also going to change in fantastic ways. I remember the first night I brought Frederick home from the hospital. You put this tiny thing into a tiny little bed and you look around and realize that the entire house has changed. 
In my case, I would have been mystified. 
He's a nice kid, Rick. 
Working here to put himself through school, right? 
He's the father, isn't he? 
Roz, if it helps, babies don't even drink milk for the first year. 
Well I didn't find out either until after I was a father. 
You never met Lilith, did you? 
BUT-I-JUST-GOT-HERE! 
Hi, we're back. As most of my faithful listeners know, every year I compose a parable that I hope will illuminate the spirit of the Christmas season. So without any further ado, I give you "The Story of Olaf, the lonely little goatherd." 
"Once upon a time, there lived a lonely little goatherd. He had no family, and no playthings, so to amuse himself, one day he carved a little wooden flute..."' 
"A flute that he used to play during the long, lonely evenings. And the tune it made was very lovely, and all the people in the village below could hear the pure, glorious sound..." 
This is all very amusing, but nothing you can do is going to distract me! 
"One day, the son of a wealthy merchant heard the music, and while that boy had all the toys in the world, he was jealous of this little goatherd's flute." 
"So, one dark-" 
"-night, one dark-" 
-windy night, The merchant's son stole his precious instrument, but when he took that flute home, he couldn't make it play. So he smashed the flute to bits." 
"When the little goatherd came down the mountain the next day, and saw his flute was broken..." 
YIKES!..."He might have said that, but instead he forgave the merchant's son. And the wealthy merchant adopted the little goatherd, and..." 
OH, MAMA!..." he said, upon meeting the merchant's wife, and somewhere along the way, he learned the true meaning of Christmas." This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you a truly blessed and forgiving holiday. 
There now, you see? Nice try. Miss Kane's delightful performance aside, this just proves the power of my message cannot be stayed... for God's sakes, what am I, a robot? 
And to all a good night. 
Dad, I'm sorry, if Frederick's anything like me, the kind of toys he'll like to play with are... 
A kitchen set, a dollhouse and three kinds of Barbies! This is for a Franklin Crane from Kenibunkport. God, you realize what this means? 
That was a cologne sample, Niles! 
Going to cave into her, aren't you? 
Maris has cancelled your credit card. 
Oh, listen Roz. I know you've got a plane to catch and the traffic to the airport is probably very bad, so in the spirit of the Christmas season, why don't you just take off early, hmm? 
Yes, I am. Be a lot easier without you sitting over there sticking your finger in your throat. 
[seeing Martin's Christmas decorations] Oh, God... it's my childhood Christmases all over again. Only now Mom isn't here to say, "Shut up, you'll hurt his feelings." 
Yeah, well I hope it can say "Geronimo" because I'm going to throw him off the balcony! 
So, Niles, did you have a discussion with Maris? 
I think Santa's said it all for us. 
Oh, yes. Inspired some spectacular Christmas nightmares the year I found them under your bed. 
God, I suppose you're right, Dad. I used to love this stuff when I was six; by the time I was seven, I started to have questions; when I was eight, I started spending a lot more time at the Bernsteins'. 
[to Niles] Thank God for the starch in that shirt or there'd be nothing holding you upright! 
Ah, the perfect marriage of subject and medium! 
Three? Yesterday it was twelve. 
It's a date. 
Yes, why? 
Honestly, Niles, by calling her so many times you've given her all the power. You're much better off coming from a position of strength.
What? 
You know, Niles, for a separated couple still hoping to reconcile, I'm afraid you're going down a path that ... 
Oh, I see. Is that your clever way of telling me that I'm dispensing unwanted criticism? 
Oh, yes: the one I wasn't invited to, but my Waterford punch bowl was. 
So, she's not really sick? 
Do you remember a time when I was... oh, six or seven years old, and you were getting ready for work, and you were getting dressed. I was playing with your badge, and you sat me down, and you said that it was not a toy, that it was a symbol of something very important - of integrity, and honesty, and helping people... Well, from then on, every time I'd see you put on that badge, I would, uh, I would think of that. 
Yeah, well, be that as it may... I've tried to live up to your example, and help other people. I've tried, as a psychiatrist, to conduct myself with the same integrity that you showed as a police officer. And, when I find myself in a quandary as to the proper course of action, I think of you wearing that badge, and then I know what I have to do. You gave me that. 
How does an arrested adolescent who barely knows two chords get a penthouse? 
I'll just add that to my list of reasons to die. 
Somebody parked in my space again and I had to park six blocks from here and sprint the whole way. By the end my tweed pants were giving off so many sparks I almost caught myself on fire. 
Go ahead, Daphne. Make my eggs. 
Oh, Niles. Niles, I'm here for you. I promise we're going to get you the best care that THIS MAN'S MONEY CAN BUY! 
[about Niles's fall in the Cafe Nervosa] My god, Niles, that was brilliant! You even got a tear in your eye! 
Daphne, don't you think you were overreacting just a bit? 
Look, Dad, would you mind terribly if I used the TV tonight? I went to three video stores to get this tape. I'm just dying to see it. 
[eyeing Eddie] Depends on the dog. 
Dad, you can't possibly expect to sleep in this racket. 
People of Seattle! Listen to me! We are not barbarians! We are not Neanderthals and we are NOT FRENCH! 
Well, Niles, I've driven on the freeway with you. The rest of the hand has been well-represented. 
Ah. Oh well, you look very nice. 
Oh boy, was I scared. I remember you holding my hand. 
Niles, surely you could recommend someone? Niles! 
So Niles, what's Dr Newman's number? Niles. Niles 
Why is it that every time we try to have a serious discussion, we end up talking about your sex life? 
Pump iron? Niles, you don't even pump your own gas. 
So what did you do? 
Just like that? 
You were this close to helping me there, Dad. 
Dad, what happens if I die tomorrow, you and Niles end up in an argument about... well, that African mask, for instance? 
Oh, a Lichtenstein! Sounds perfect! 
[Niles and Daphne are alone in his house] My God, it's a recipe for disaster! You've got a vulnerable woman and an unstable man in a gothic mansion on a rainy night! The only thing missing is someone shouting "Heathcliff!" across the moors! 
Oh hi, Roz, how are you? 
Well, I was just making conversation. 
Actually, Roz, there's some advice I need. 
A subject in which you're quite well-versed, sex. 
What do you do when the romance goes out of a relationship? 
Roz, this is not for me, this is for my brother, Niles. 
Well, that's perfectly normal in a relationship of some years. Maybe you should try spicing things up a bit? 
For starters, yeah. 
Well, the two of you could... well, you could... well, it's you and Maris, so you could... I'm stumped. 
Oh, I think that's implied. 
All right, just keep in mind that I reserve the right to say "stop" at any time. 
STOP! 
Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane. I'm listening. 
Niles, have you been self-medicating again? 
You are not getting the rest of my scone, so just forget it... 
Mmm. Really good, too. Yum, yum yum yum. Listen, I don't care, you can sit there 'til you're blue in the face. As far as I'm concerned, you don't even exist, you're not even here. 
Oh, all right, here! Get fat! 
I am not. 
Maybe he doesn't like what you're eating. 
Yes, we tampered with the natural order of things. 
[raises his glass] To the circle of life. 
Well Daphne, we're not plumbers, we're psychiatrists. 
He certainly didn't recognize you just now. 
You know the expression, "Living well is the best revenge"? 
All right, Niles. 
Oh, all right! 
A jet pack! 
Thanks, Dad. Can I buy you a beer? 
You should have been at the condo-board meeting, Dad. You missed all the excitement. 
Not this time. I gave the greatest speech of my condo-board career, which led to a vote, which led to the ruling that Cam Winston must now park that SUV monstrosity of his in the subbasement. 
Then, we had cookies. 
Dad, I am an orator. It is not only that which is said, but the passion with which it is said. 
That's because I'm not orating right now. 
Cam, if there is any benefit to me, it is the cleaner air which we will all now breathe. 
If mine's a substitute for masculinity, then what is yours? 
Dad, we are protected by this building's constitution. Believe me, I will have Cam cited for a noise violation if he so much as drops a hint. 
I do not! 
"You and me," Dad. 
Niles, will you relax? You always make a good first impression. 
You wanna trade? Simon put my sixty-five-dollar apricot skin polish on his muffins! 
Yes, that is a splendid idea. This land is rich with snow covered mountains, sun kissed beaches... wild, untamed rivers and a-a warm, loving people ready to embrace you. Immerse yourself in the spectacle and the grandeur that are these United States, this... America. 
God, I hate lawyers. 
Yeah, well, that file's getting pretty thick! 
By the way, where's Maris? I haven't seen her all night. 
My bed? 
What were you two doing back there? 
Yeeeess? 
Niles, what is the name of that really vicious lawyer that you use? 
Well, the meanest. 
Damn it, Niles, where is the justice? Where am I supposed to turn to? I'm a, a beloved household personality and I've been screwed! 
Why don't you just go away? This is no concern of yours. 
How? 
Niles, why are you telling me this? 
I said that? 
Well, Niles, if you were strong enough to show restraint after so much humiliation, not to mention the nicknames. 
Oh, you didn't know that? Oh dear God, yes. Uh, "Peachfuzz,"..."Jingle Bells"... I can't remember the rest. 
Yes, I believe Coach Medwick made that one up himself. 
Well, anyway, here you are. I won't be needing this anymore. 
My God, Niles! What are you, what have you done? 
I know how bleak these times can be, but believe me, they will come to an end sometime or later. I remember a time back in Boston, I was going through exactly what you're going through now. Just a week later I met a lovely barmaid, sophisticated if a bit loquacious. We fell madly in love and we got engaged... 'course, she left me standing at the altar. But the point is, I didn't give up. I took my poor battered heart and handed it to Lilith... who put it in her little Cuisinart and hit the purée button. But I rebounded! And look how far I've come. I'm divorced, lonely, and living with my father. 
Really? You've been seeing a man? 
That's my brother, Niles. He's a little... how would you describe Niles, Dad? 
[on Daphne] She's just having trouble finding men. 
No, Roz, Roz, it's really not necessary. You do not have to donate one of your boyfriends to Daphne. 
But still, one hates to break up a collection. 
I don't think so. 
A German narcissist. Now there's an appealing combination. 
All right! Niles, you are completely out of line here. And Roz, he does have a point. You and Daphne are entirely different kinds of women. While Daphne is very shy and inexperienced, you are more... well, a lot more... well, actually it's hard to find anyone who's more... 
No, it's what I'm trying not to say, and you're not making it very easy. 
Oh, Roz, please wait. 
Will you please relax? Look, I told you, this is not a set-up. Tom doesn't even know you'll be here. 
Just keep in mind, Tom is just a co-worker who's coming by for a pleasant little dinner. If some sparks should ignite, then fine, but there is no pressure, absolutely no pressure... is that what you're wearing? 
Don't you have something with a little more oomph? Oh, what about that, that strapless number you have? 
Well, thanks to my fraternity days, as a matter of fact I do. 
Tom, I'd like you to meet Daphne. Daphne this is Tom Duran. 
Oh, sorry. 
[upon realizing that Tom is gay] Niles, do you realize what this means? 
That's ridiculous! Tom is not gay! 
Well, a barracuda is what you want in an agent, Niles. Well, it's just that the station's been sold, I was hoping she might have some scuttlebutt on the new owner. I must admit she's rather hard to get a hold of these days. 
She's trying to quit smoking. 
This is very good, Bebe. You're already identifying those moments that trigger your worst cravings. 
No, really, perhaps it would help to know that you're not alone. Dad is an ex-smoker; Dad, can you tell us about when you crave a cigarette most? 
What is so wonderful about smoking? 
[enters] What the hell's going on out here? 
For God's sake... I don't care anymore. You know, I can't help you, nobody can. You want to ruin it for both of us? Here... 
...go ahead, knock yourself out. 
I only wish I could be there when it happens. 
When you see that newspaper headline: "Big Willy Boone, Millionaire, Dead." Oh, how I wish I could be there when you watch the funeral on the news. Watch the casket being slipped into the ground. Only, you won't be watching that. No, no, you'll be watching... the widow Boone. Tiffany, perhaps. Oh no, better yet, "Kelli" - with an "I"! 
You'll picture her wearing YOUR jewels, sailing in YOUR yachts, sleeping with *your* gigolos - but, oh, you won't be sad, no, no, no! 
Because you'll have your cigarette. 
Yeah! Clutched in your nicotine-stained teeth, smoke whirling about your once-pretty, now creased, leathery, smoke-ravaged... 
Well, they were halfway down the aisle - Big Willy beaming proudly, Bebe radiant, supporting Big Willy on her arm - when suddenly he clutched his heart, and his head slumped against Bebe's shoulder. Of course we were all concerned at first, but then suddenly it seemed like he was all right because they kept moving on down the aisle. But if you looked carefully, you could see Bebe's little biceps bulging through her wedding gown, and I swear I noticed daylight between Big Willy's dress boots and the carpet. Well, once they got up to the minister the jig was pretty well up, despite Bebe's valiant attempts to animate his features by twisting the loose skin at the back of his neck. You know, I've never seen a woman more crushed. 
Niles, Big Willy's eighty five; he's on his third pacemaker. 
For God's sake... I don't care anymore. You know, I can't help you, nobody can. You want to ruin it for both of us? Here... 
...go ahead, knock yourself out. 
I only wish I could be there when it happens. 
When you see that newspaper headline: "Big Willy Boone, Millionaire, Dead." Oh, how I wish I could be there when you watch the funeral on the news. Watch the casket being slipped into the ground.

Oh, no, don't be silly, Mr. Boone. 
Don't be silly, Big Willy. 
Well, we all are, at some point in our lives. Remember when you used to think the 1812 Overture was a great piece of classical music? 
Oh Dad, how do you know if you don't try it? 
Well, I'll go out on a limb and take that as a compliment. 
[about Daphne] She's psychic. We've decided to find it charming. 
Oh dear God, yes. 
If you bring him two - if you bring him four - he'll send it back. 
The same. 
How much extra would I have to pay to get one from the refrigerator? 
I wish this was one of those times. 
[as Martin is leaving restaurant in disgust after Frasier's and Niles's insulting remarks] Niles! Say something! 
Well in that case, you should outlive Styrofoam. 
That'll be Niles. I'm taking him to lunch to get his mind off his troubles. 
Dad, I'm sorry, I don't think he's ready to talk about it so we're not talking about it. 
Now listen. I know you're upset, but let's remember why you left Maris in the first place: you were tired of groveling. 
Yes. All it takes is stealth, cunning and a key to the door. 
Right...! Wait! What if Maris is out of pills? 
[chuckling] Oh, I see. 
Niles, this painting here in the living room, have you always had this? 
No, no, it must be a different painting. This is Maris next to a really big tree. 
In that case, I wouldn't look too closely at the face of that skunk in the flowerbed. 
How so? 
Oh, that candelabra? 
I think you owe us all a candelabra for that. 
If you choose you never have to see Maris again. 
Well, we had an argument one day. He called me a stuffed shirt and hung up on me. I was mad. 
[to Martin] You were dead! What did it matter? 
Oh my God... I slept with that woman three months ago. 
Yes! 
What the hell you do mean, you were about to get married? 
All right, all right, look, look, Sam, come, let's have a seat here and start this thing from the very beginning. Now, who is this woman? 
You know, Sam, it's always amazed me how you can elevate and demean in the same sentence. 
You know, for most guys that's just an expression. 
This is Roz Doyle. 
Oh, boy. Just look at the two of you face to face. I imagine wild animals all over the Northwest are lifting their heads, alerted to the scent. Good-bye, Roz. 
Yes, it glows in the dark. 
Well, of course he's flirting with her. He flirts with everybody. He can't help it, he's a sexual compulsive. But he's getting help for it in a support group. 
So, that's our show for today. Don't forget, Bob "Bulldog" Brisco is up next and... oh, yes. This is KACL Cash Call Week. $5,000 when you answer your phone with the phrase that pays. So when your phone rings, don't say "hello", say... 
Well, blow me down! No, no, no, no! Just, uh, say, uh, "KACL is the talk of the town." Talk of Seattle, whatever. Bye-bye. 
What's all this? 
Niles? 
Good. 
Niles, you are giving a woman money in order to obtain physical affection! We are talking the world's oldest profession. Granted, this is sort of the Walt Disney version, but still. It's wrong, and I insist you stop it. 
Snap out of it! What you were doing was completely dishonest. 
What does that mean? 
Oh, don't be ridiculous! Our two situations are totally different. 
Well, for one thing, you've been misleading a woman for your own selfish gain. 
Well, I'm not finished. She was also trusting you to tell the truth! 
Your woman is English! 
I know, I know. It's just going to take a little while to climb down off of this particular high horse. 
Well, I have. Believe me, after one page, I was yearning for the worldly cynicism of Barney the Dinosaur. 
Niles, will you please stop giggling? It's very distracting. 
I'm trying to recommend the book. Reading it doesn't help. 
As a matter of fact, yes. 
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want Niles to know who I'm dating? 
I would sooner attend a hoedown. 
Dad, when a man has no front teeth and stitches on his nose, I think it's safe to assume he's sensitive to criticism. 
Dad! Dad! I can't read my paper! Eddie keeps staring at me! 
I'm trying to! 
Thank you, Niles. You're a good brother and a credit to the psychiatric profession. 
The brown one. 
[pings timer] No sports. 
A couple of years, eh? 
Either that, or it'll seem like eternity. 
Niles, I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't read my book. I can't have my coffee. I can't have any peace in my own home. 
Well, I'd love to have a beer with you, Dad. 
Ah, yes, the Crane family specialty. Two fat-fried eggs, dripping with grease, swimming in fat, with thick pieces of bacon and mayonaise on a piece of white bread, no crust. I can practically hear my left ventricle slamming shut even as we speak. 
Where are the Thomasons? Why is that dog still here? 
Oh for God's sake, he works at the zoo! She's a nurse, Billy's an altar boy and Kathy is a Campfire Girl! 
They had a ten-acre farm! If they'd taken me, I'd have gone with them! 
You know Dad, I've just developed a very interesting theory about you... 
Slowly, over the years, your responsibilities have been taken away from you, and you, well, you feel symbolically castrated. 
Stop! Dogs only need names if you're going to call them to you, which we're not! 
Niles, you have liver behind your ears. 
You're saying you had a wad of cold meat behind your ears and you didn't feel it? 
Mrs. Greenway, there's no way Eddie could be the father - he's been neutered. 
Oh my God! They're miniature Eddies! 
[to Eddie] Bad dog! Look what you've done! 
For God sakes, don't love them! They'll think they're staying! 
[with the box of puppies] No, no we don't want them taking after their father. It may be too late already... 
Oh for God's sake, stop staring at me! 
You know, Niles, what say I buy us dinner and a lot of martinis? 
Bulldog, is there nothing I can say to appeal to your sense of decency? 
[to himself] Like a guy. Like a guy. 
SCREW HER! 
[angrily] Yeah, you don't need her. She's trash! 
You're better off without her; We both are! 
Yeah, so do I! Unattractive, yet liberating, rather like the one and only time I wore a European bathing suit. 
I'm sorry. SHE'S A BITCH! 
You're right. All she did was save you the trouble of having to dump her! 
There you go! 
That's right! 
[shaking his hand] Likewise. You know, I could talk like this for another thirty seconds. 
[walking back in the booth with Bulldog] She was nothing! She was less than nothing! Tomorrow you're gonna find someone even hotter and you know what you're gonna do? 
You're gonna have your fun with her and then you're gonna dump her just for the hell of it! 
And you know what? You're not gonna feel bad about it at all. You know why? Because we're GUYS and THAT'S WHAT GUYS DO! 
Niles, was that Natalie Spencer I just saw you talking with? 
And? 
So I'm not crazy. 
Oh, fewer nuts, more money - something I've been aspiring to for my entire professional life! 
I bought tickets to an event which is right up their aisle. I felt so mortified just buying the tickets, I paid cash so they couldn't trace it back to me. 
Oh, good Lord! 
Oh, don't look so smug, you try skating and blowing into a jug while your heart's breaking! 
You try skating and blowing into a jug while your heart is breaking. 
Dad, there was a time after my first marriage was breaking up, I was talking to Mom. She said to me, "Frasier, you've got to promise me you're not going to give up." I said, "Mom, please, the last thing I want to hear is a bunch of clich s, and that we're all put on the earth to love each other, and how it's certainly possible for the human heart to love more than one person." I said, "Alright, Mom, give me one good reason to ever let myself fall in love again." She said, "Because I said so and I'm your mother!" 
No. 
The vain, neurotic, lying Roz? 
I have no intention in repairing the rift. God, last night for the first time in months I wasn't jolted awake at two a.m. by her rousing rendition of "Funky Mountain Breakdown"! 
Yes... 
So, for the second time in two nights Sherry manages to chase away another date! She's like a scarecrow in the cornfield of my love life! 
All right, young animal: learn from the master. Now, follow these time-honored traditions, and you too might get lucky with that young Pekinese peach you've been eyeing in the park. Now, for mood: Vivaldi. And then, for lighting: not so bright as to show the wrinkles, not so dark as to make her think you're hiding anything. And leaving nothing to chance... 
Pouily Fuisse 1992, elector a la carte. Dear God, I could teach a course! 
Oh, there's my canapés. 
You'll get a full debriefing - as, hopefully, will I. 
Niles! I'd offer you a sherry, but I'm fresh out! 
Well no, not after what happened last time. Your watchband got caught in my hair. 
Daphne, shh... do you hear that? 
The sound of a Sherry-free apartment. I've been basking in it for the last thirty minutes. Right now, I feel like a seafront village after the Vikings have left. 
"Not bad"? If I didn't know better, I'd say someone was a little jealous. After this weekend you may have to give up your dating crown. 
It's a wonder you could rotate anything after that. 
Not hardly, I wouldn't do that sort of thing. I came over here to gloat because *two* women came onto me! 
My God, I've never had a night like this in my entire life! I'm a babe magnet, I'm catnip! 
Well Niles, I'll tell you what. Seeing as how Cupid has so amply stocked my quiver this evening, I shall try and shine on your behalf. 
Not so fast, Mr. Hicks. You won't find me doing anything foolish. 
Daphne. 
Yes, you too. 
Try hauling it out of here! 
What are you doing? 
There's a hidden camera up there? 
Well Niles, it doesn't look like anybody is leaving; why don't we take a table outside? 
No, God is crying! 
Do you ask any other kind? 
Oh, just something that happened the other morning. I asked Dad to pass me a bran muffin, you know what he said to me? He said "What's the magic word?" 
He didn't think it was very amusing when I said "rest home"! 
"Wow"? Did you say "Wow"? 
Oh, absolutely. It means you're a gay man. Your life with Maris was a charade and you should have come out of the closet years ago. Are you going to tell Dad or shall I? 
So, what's new? 
How did that turn out? 
Well, good for her. Apparently it's bringing out her spiritual side. 
What is it now? 
How do you get through the day? 
Oh, I wouldn't say that's true. If it were... oh, forget it. 
I'd rather not. 
So, you really do love her? 
You mean it's not human? 
I'm told it was a lot like that near the end in the Hitler household. 
Niles, it isn't a question of liking or not liking. She despises you. 
I think you may be on to something there, Sherlock! 
A dollar-fifty. 
Oh, I tried that damn hand cream, it was so oily I couldn't get a grip on the doorknob. I waited to be rescued, finally when some guy came in I said, "Oh God, am I glad to see you." I can't even begin to describe the look he gave me. 
There it is! 
Oh well, the best thing to do is just ignore him when he gets sarcastic. Isn't that right, Niles... Niles? 
Look, why don't we just change the subject from Dad, and talk about something else. 
I agree... Are you in love with Daphne? 
That's a little frothier than I had in mind. 
Oh, I'm sorry Roz, why don't you join us? 
You think she's kidding, don't you? 
Niles! 
I suppose the situation you're in is, you'd like to stay with Maris, but you'd like to have an affair with Daphne. 
No you can't! 
Well, I asked, but it was an Olympic year. The agency was fresh out. 
Six months ago, I was living in Boston. My wife had left me, which was very painful. Then she came back to me, which was excruciating. On top of that, my practice had grown stagnant, and my social life consisted of hanging around a bar night after night. You see, I was clinging to a life that wasn't working, and I knew I had to do something, anything. So I ended the marriage once and for all, packed up my things, and moved back here to my hometown of Seattle. Go Seahawks. 
Who? 
Is there a reason you're telling me this story? 
Remind me again how it worked for Lupe, last seen with her head in the toilet. 
Dad, what do you think of that view, huh? Hey, that's the Space Needle there. 
I do. I like her from a distance. You know, the way you like the sun. Maris is like the sun. Except without the warmth. 
How was I today? 
You're a psychiatrist, you know what it's like to listen to people prattling on endlessly about their mundane lives. 
No, not Eddie! 
But he's weird! He gives me the creeps, all he does is stare at me! 
No, I'm a psychiatrist. 
It's safe with us. Well, Miss Moon, I think we've learned everything we need to about you, and a dash extra! 
My study? You expect me to give up my study, the place where I read, where I do my most profound thinking? 
I mean "burden" in its most positive sense. 
It says that? 
Oh, God, I am, aren't I? 
Have you ever had an unexpressed thought? 
Dad as dear as this piece is to you, I just don't think it goes with anything here. 
Oh, Niles... 
Niles, you know I'm right. 
I most certainly am too! 
Did it work? 
As a matter of fact, this day only comes around once every four years. Hmm... You know, it's like a free day - a gift. We should do something special - be bold. It's leap year - take a leap! 
Niles, I don't mind telling you, I'm a little bit concerned about this. Maris claps her hands; you come running? 
Oh, surely you're exaggerating. You've only been separated for three. 
You really want to sacrifice your self-respect for a roll in the hay? 
Of course not. Just don't think about sex. 
Grandma in a teddy. 
Well, I can see the unseasonable sunshine has done nothing to improve your mood. 
Alimony aside, I found it rather liberating. 
How bad do you think it is? 
You will rue the day! 
It may be an unwise man that doesn't learn from his own mistakes but it's an absolute idiot that doesn't learn from other people's. 
Hippity-bippity-boppity-bow, something and something and buttons and bows! 
East is East, and West is West and the wrong one I have chose! Let's go where you keep on wearing those- 
da-da-dahhs, and boppa dohs, things and buttons, buttons and bows! Don't bury me, uh - lovely pea, something, la-la-laaaaa! Let's all go to a... taco show, and a how I love, such and thrush, blow my nose, You look great in buttons and bows! I love you in buckskin, la da-da da-da daaaa! 
Everybody! My bones denounce, the fearful trounce, and la-la la-la Moldic rose! Ba-da Seuss, a palm caboose, and a panda hop, and pantyhose, you look buppity, buttons and bowwwws! 
"For of all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these: it might have been." 
We're back, Seattle. And in accordance with new station policy, we're going to be pandering to the lowest human instinct. In other words: "Who wants to talk about sex?" Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. 
Oh, for God's sake, I am trying to get some sleep! I asked you to keep that dog quiet, and instead you outfit him with a megaphone! In the last thirty-six hours I haven't had so much as a nap, and I've got to be back at the station by 2 A.M. 
Eddie, listen carefully. By the time this day is up, one of us is going to sleep. 
DON'T! I've had my share of women's opinions for the week, between the station's new Reich Chancellor and Roz's incessant whining! As far as I'm concerned, your entire sex can put a sock in it! 
Damn it! 
Kate, what a pleasure! 
Really? Well, thank you very much! I like to think of my show as a haven for the tempest-tossed in the maelstrom of everyday life. 
Really stunk up the airwaves with that one, didn't we? 
Well, for starters, you at Le Ralee. It's a two-week wait. 
Don't worry, Roz, we will she just moved us to break our spirit. 
Hello. 
As a matter of fact, I found it invigorating! Didn't you, Roz? Remember that woman who called in, uh, you know, with the delusions of grandeur? Couldn't understand why nobody liked her. 
Oh yes, respect is important. So is self-respect. 
Yes, but those people are usually rigid little demagogues who don't know the difference between the kind of respect that is earned and the kind of respect that is irrespective... of what others expect. 
I think I made myself clear. 
Good luck! 
Steady, Roz. She may have been able to intimidate people in other situations, but here at KACL she'll find that we are NOT a bunch of spineless twits! 
Hello, Line Two, you're on with Dr. Frasier Crane. 
Hello, Mark. I'm listening. 
Oh God, Roz, I don't think I've helped a single person tonight. 
Well, you're the one who's supposed to keep track of who's on what line! 
While Kitty laces up her leather bustier, this is Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL. All talk! All night! All naked! 
You know, one of these days, you are going to misquote someone, and I'm going land on you like a sumo wrestler. 
What's all this? 
Oh. Is that coffee cake I smell? 
Oh, for heaven's sake, Niles. You don't even know how to pack a lunch. 
What the hell was that? Was that a gunshot? 
Just getting up? Are you out of your mind? A gun just went off in here! 
Oh, I'm sorry, was I snippy? I didn't realize it was too much to ask that there not be gunplay in my living room! 
Oh, the new station manager's taking over today. She wanted to meet with all of us. 
Yes. Why? 
That's absurd. If I had trouble taking orders from a woman, Frederick would never have been conceived. 
Eddie, I believe that question was directed at you. 
You don't care? 
Hello? Oh, just a second, please. Dad, is Daphne in her room? 
For God's sake, I can yell! 
Would you hold, please? 
Niles, before you do something rash, you should consider it from all angles. 
Hello? Oh, just a second, please. Dad, is Daphne in her room? 
For God's sake, I can yell! 
Would you hold, please? 
How flattering: They've named a bar after her. 
Shouldn't you make a beeping noise when you back up like that? 
Roz wades in with the Gabor approach to psychiatry. 
Niles, be careful. Whatever you do, don't engage him in a physical fight. The whole thing would just look too weird! 
Let's serve our guests their coffee! 
Here we are, coffee. Milk's on its way; Niles is still steaming. 
Yes well, as I said to you the time you tried to jump out of the treehouse with an umbrella, "I suppose you know what you're doing." 
You do have a wonderful new woman in your life now, don't you? 
And Adelle does make you very happy, doesn't she? 
Well, then, if you've ever taken any of my advice before, take this: Adelle could very well be the path to your happiness. 
But let's just say I'm wrong. 
Roz, I'm going to tell you something that I didn't learn until I became a father. You don't just love your children. You fall in love with them. 
Morning, Roz! 
Oh, I realize it must be a shock to see me here in this place I come to every day of my life. 
Hey, Dad, what are you doing here? 
I think they call them "bras" now. 
Yes, I noticed. 
Unbelievable! 
I'll talk to him again. 
Yes, of course. Just remember the baby's future, Roz. Try to make it look like an accident. 
You get to share your life with a remarkable little creature... who only lives in the present, runs around naked without the slightest bit of shame, and can entertain himself for hours just staring at a shiny object. Isn't that wonderful? 
Talk to me. 
Yes. But it's also going to change in fantastic ways. I remember the first night I brought Frederick home from the hospital. You put this tiny thing into a tiny little bed and you look around and realize that the entire house has changed. 
In my case, I would have been mystified. 
He's a nice kid, Rick. 
Working here to put himself through school, right? 
He's the father, isn't he? 
Roz, if it helps, babies don't even drink milk for the first year. 
Well I didn't find out either until after I was a father. 
You never met Lilith, did you? 
BUT-I-JUST-GOT-HERE! 
Hi, we're back. As most of my faithful listeners know, every year I compose a parable that I hope will illuminate the spirit of the Christmas season. So without any further ado, I give you "The Story of Olaf, the lonely little goatherd." 
"Once upon a time, there lived a lonely little goatherd. He had no family, and no playthings, so to amuse himself, one day he carved a little wooden flute..."' 
"A flute that he used to play during the long, lonely evenings. And the tune it made was very lovely, and all the people in the village below could hear the pure, glorious sound..." 
This is all very amusing, but nothing you can do is going to distract me! 
"One day, the son of a wealthy merchant heard the music, and while that boy had all the toys in the world, he was jealous of this little goatherd's flute." 
"So, one dark-" 
"-night, one dark-" 
-windy night, The merchant's son stole his precious instrument, but when he took that flute home, he couldn't make it play. So he smashed the flute to bits." 
"When the little goatherd came down the mountain the next day, and saw his flute was broken..." 
YIKES!..."He might have said that, but instead he forgave the merchant's son. And the wealthy merchant adopted the little goatherd, and..." 
OH, MAMA!..." he said, upon meeting the merchant's wife, and somewhere along the way, he learned the true meaning of Christmas." This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you a truly blessed and forgiving holiday. 
There now, you see? Nice try. Miss Kane's delightful performance aside, this just proves the power of my message cannot be stayed... for God's sakes, what am I, a robot? 
And to all a good night. 
Dad, I'm sorry, if Frederick's anything like me, the kind of toys he'll like to play with are... 
A kitchen set, a dollhouse and three kinds of Barbies! This is for a Franklin Crane from Kenibunkport. God, you realize what this means? 
That was a cologne sample, Niles! 
Going to cave into her, aren't you? 
Maris has cancelled your credit card. 
Oh, listen Roz. I know you've got a plane to catch and the traffic to the airport is probably very bad, so in the spirit of the Christmas season, why don't you just take off early, hmm? 
Yes, I am. Be a lot easier without you sitting over there sticking your finger in your throat. 
[seeing Martin's Christmas decorations] Oh, God... it's my childhood Christmases all over again. Only now Mom isn't here to say, "Shut up, you'll hurt his feelings." 
Yeah, well I hope it can say "Geronimo" because I'm going to throw him off the balcony! 
So, Niles, did you have a discussion with Maris? 
I think Santa's said it all for us. 
Oh, yes. Inspired some spectacular Christmas nightmares the year I found them under your bed. 
God, I suppose you're right, Dad. I used to love this stuff when I was six; by the time I was seven, I started to have questions; when I was eight, I started spending a lot more time at the Bernsteins'. 
[to Niles] Thank God for the starch in that shirt or there'd be nothing holding you upright! 
Ah, the perfect marriage of subject and medium! 
Three? Yesterday it was twelve. 
It's a date. 
Yes, why? 
Honestly, Niles, by calling her so many times you've given her all the power. You're much better off coming from a position of strength.
What? 
You know, Niles, for a separated couple still hoping to reconcile, I'm afraid you're going down a path that ... 
Oh, I see. Is that your clever way of telling me that I'm dispensing unwanted criticism? 
Oh, yes: the one I wasn't invited to, but my Waterford punch bowl was. 
So, she's not really sick? 
Do you remember a time when I was... oh, six or seven years old, and you were getting ready for work, and you were getting dressed. I was playing with your badge, and you sat me down, and you said that it was not a toy, that it was a symbol of something very important - of integrity, and honesty, and helping people... Well, from then on, every time I'd see you put on that badge, I would, uh, I would think of that. 
Yeah, well, be that as it may... I've tried to live up to your example, and help other people. I've tried, as a psychiatrist, to conduct myself with the same integrity that you showed as a police officer. And, when I find myself in a quandary as to the proper course of action, I think of you wearing that badge, and then I know what I have to do. You gave me that. 
How does an arrested adolescent who barely knows two chords get a penthouse? 
I'll just add that to my list of reasons to die. 
Somebody parked in my space again and I had to park six blocks from here and sprint the whole way. By the end my tweed pants were giving off so many sparks I almost caught myself on fire. 
Go ahead, Daphne. Make my eggs. 
Oh, Niles. Niles, I'm here for you. I promise we're going to get you the best care that THIS MAN'S MONEY CAN BUY! 
[about Niles's fall in the Cafe Nervosa] My god, Niles, that was brilliant! You even got a tear in your eye! 
Daphne, don't you think you were overreacting just a bit? 
Look, Dad, would you mind terribly if I used the TV tonight? I went to three video stores to get this tape. I'm just dying to see it. 
[eyeing Eddie] Depends on the dog. 
Dad, you can't possibly expect to sleep in this racket. 
People of Seattle! Listen to me! We are not barbarians! We are not Neanderthals and we are NOT FRENCH! 
Well, Niles, I've driven on the freeway with you. The rest of the hand has been well-represented. 
Ah. Oh well, you look very nice. 
Oh boy, was I scared. I remember you holding my hand. 
Niles, surely you could recommend someone? Niles! 
So Niles, what's Dr Newman's number? Niles. Niles 
Why is it that every time we try to have a serious discussion, we end up talking about your sex life? 
Pump iron? Niles, you don't even pump your own gas. 
So what did you do? 
Just like that? 
You were this close to helping me there, Dad. 
Dad, what happens if I die tomorrow, you and Niles end up in an argument about... well, that African mask, for instance? 
Oh, a Lichtenstein! Sounds perfect! 
[Niles and Daphne are alone in his house] My God, it's a recipe for disaster! You've got a vulnerable woman and an unstable man in a gothic mansion on a rainy night! The only thing missing is someone shouting "Heathcliff!" across the moors! 
Oh hi, Roz, how are you? 
Well, I was just making conversation. 
Actually, Roz, there's some advice I need. 
A subject in which you're quite well-versed, sex. 
What do you do when the romance goes out of a relationship? 
Roz, this is not for me, this is for my brother, Niles. 
Well, that's perfectly normal in a relationship of some years. Maybe you should try spicing things up a bit? 
For starters, yeah. 
Well, the two of you could... well, you could... well, it's you and Maris, so you could... I'm stumped. 
Oh, I think that's implied. 
All right, just keep in mind that I reserve the right to say "stop" at any time. 
STOP! 
Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane. I'm listening. 
Niles, have you been self-medicating again? 
You are not getting the rest of my scone, so just forget it... 
Mmm. Really good, too. Yum, yum yum yum. Listen, I don't care, you can sit there 'til you're blue in the face. As far as I'm concerned, you don't even exist, you're not even here. 
Oh, all right, here! Get fat! 
I am not. 
Maybe he doesn't like what you're eating. 
Yes, we tampered with the natural order of things. 
[raises his glass] To the circle of life. 
Well Daphne, we're not plumbers, we're psychiatrists. 
He certainly didn't recognize you just now. 
You know the expression, "Living well is the best revenge"? 
All right, Niles. 
Oh, all right! 
A jet pack! 
Thanks, Dad. Can I buy you a beer? 
You should have been at the condo-board meeting, Dad. You missed all the excitement. 
Not this time. I gave the greatest speech of my condo-board career, which led to a vote, which led to the ruling that Cam Winston must now park that SUV monstrosity of his in the subbasement. 
Then, we had cookies. 
Dad, I am an orator. It is not only that which is said, but the passion with which it is said. 
That's because I'm not orating right now. 
Cam, if there is any benefit to me, it is the cleaner air which we will all now breathe. 
If mine's a substitute for masculinity, then what is yours? 
Dad, we are protected by this building's constitution. Believe me, I will have Cam cited for a noise violation if he so much as drops a hint. 
I do not! 
"You and me," Dad. 
Niles, will you relax? You always make a good first impression. 
You wanna trade? Simon put my sixty-five-dollar apricot skin polish on his muffins! 
Yes, that is a splendid idea. This land is rich with snow covered mountains, sun kissed beaches... wild, untamed rivers and a-a warm, loving people ready to embrace you. Immerse yourself in the spectacle and the grandeur that are these United States, this... America. 
God, I hate lawyers. 
Yeah, well, that file's getting pretty thick! 
By the way, where's Maris? I haven't seen her all night. 
My bed? 
What were you two doing back there? 
Yeeeess? 
Niles, what is the name of that really vicious lawyer that you use? 
Well, the meanest. 
Damn it, Niles, where is the justice? Where am I supposed to turn to? I'm a, a beloved household personality and I've been screwed! 
Why don't you just go away? This is no concern of yours. 
How? 
Niles, why are you telling me this? 
I said that? 
Well, Niles, if you were strong enough to show restraint after so much humiliation, not to mention the nicknames. 
Oh, you didn't know that? Oh dear God, yes. Uh, "Peachfuzz,"..."Jingle Bells"... I can't remember the rest. 
Yes, I believe Coach Medwick made that one up himself. 
Well, anyway, here you are. I won't be needing this anymore. 
My God, Niles! What are you, what have you done? 
I know how bleak these times can be, but believe me, they will come to an end sometime or later. I remember a time back in Boston, I was going through exactly what you're going through now. Just a week later I met a lovely barmaid, sophisticated if a bit loquacious. We fell madly in love and we got engaged... 'course, she left me standing at the altar. But the point is, I didn't give up. I took my poor battered heart and handed it to Lilith... who put it in her little Cuisinart and hit the purée button. But I rebounded! And look how far I've come. I'm divorced, lonely, and living with my father. 
Really? You've been seeing a man? 
That's my brother, Niles. He's a little... how would you describe Niles, Dad? 
[on Daphne] She's just having trouble finding men. 
No, Roz, Roz, it's really not necessary. You do not have to donate one of your boyfriends to Daphne. 
But still, one hates to break up a collection. 
I don't think so. 
A German narcissist. Now there's an appealing combination. 
All right! Niles, you are completely out of line here. And Roz, he does have a point. You and Daphne are entirely different kinds of women. While Daphne is very shy and inexperienced, you are more... well, a lot more... well, actually it's hard to find anyone who's more... 
No, it's what I'm trying not to say, and you're not making it very easy. 
Oh, Roz, please wait. 
Will you please relax? Look, I told you, this is not a set-up. Tom doesn't even know you'll be here. 
Just keep in mind, Tom is just a co-worker who's coming by for a pleasant little dinner. If some sparks should ignite, then fine, but there is no pressure, absolutely no pressure... is that what you're wearing? 
Don't you have something with a little more oomph? Oh, what about that, that strapless number you have? 
Well, thanks to my fraternity days, as a matter of fact I do. 
Tom, I'd like you to meet Daphne. Daphne this is Tom Duran. 
Oh, sorry. 
[upon realizing that Tom is gay] Niles, do you realize what this means? 
That's ridiculous! Tom is not gay! 
Well, a barracuda is what you want in an agent, Niles. Well, it's just that the station's been sold, I was hoping she might have some scuttlebutt on the new owner. I must admit she's rather hard to get a hold of these days. 
She's trying to quit smoking. 
This is very good, Bebe. You're already identifying those moments that trigger your worst cravings. 
No, really, perhaps it would help to know that you're not alone. Dad is an ex-smoker; Dad, can you tell us about when you crave a cigarette most? 
What is so wonderful about smoking? 
[enters] What the hell's going on out here? 
For God's sake... I don't care anymore. You know, I can't help you, nobody can. You want to ruin it for both of us? Here... 
...go ahead, knock yourself out. 
I only wish I could be there when it happens. 
When you see that newspaper headline: "Big Willy Boone, Millionaire, Dead." Oh, how I wish I could be there when you watch the funeral on the news. Watch the casket being slipped into the ground. Only, you won't be watching that. No, no, you'll be watching... the widow Boone. Tiffany, perhaps. Oh no, better yet, "Kelli" - with an "I"! 
You'll picture her wearing YOUR jewels, sailing in YOUR yachts, sleeping with *your* gigolos - but, oh, you won't be sad, no, no, no! 
Because you'll have your cigarette. 
Yeah! Clutched in your nicotine-stained teeth, smoke whirling about your once-pretty, now creased, leathery, smoke-ravaged... 
Well, they were halfway down the aisle - Big Willy beaming proudly, Bebe radiant, supporting Big Willy on her arm - when suddenly he clutched his heart, and his head slumped against Bebe's shoulder. Of course we were all concerned at first, but then suddenly it seemed like he was all right because they kept moving on down the aisle. But if you looked carefully, you could see Bebe's little biceps bulging through her wedding gown, and I swear I noticed daylight between Big Willy's dress boots and the carpet. Well, once they got up to the minister the jig was pretty well up, despite Bebe's valiant attempts to animate his features by twisting the loose skin at the back of his neck. You know, I've never seen a woman more crushed. 
Niles, Big Willy's eighty five; he's on his third pacemaker. 
For God's sake... I don't care anymore. You know, I can't help you, nobody can. You want to ruin it for both of us? Here... 
...go ahead, knock yourself out. 
I only wish I could be there when it happens.

Oh, no, don't be silly, Mr. Boone. 
Don't be silly, Big Willy. 
Well, we all are, at some point in our lives. Remember when you used to think the 1812 Overture was a great piece of classical music? 
Oh Dad, how do you know if you don't try it? 
Well, I'll go out on a limb and take that as a compliment. 
[about Daphne] She's psychic. We've decided to find it charming. 
Oh dear God, yes. 
If you bring him two - if you bring him four - he'll send it back. 
The same. 
How much extra would I have to pay to get one from the refrigerator? 
I wish this was one of those times. 
[as Martin is leaving restaurant in disgust after Frasier's and Niles's insulting remarks] Niles! Say something! 
Well in that case, you should outlive Styrofoam. 
That'll be Niles. I'm taking him to lunch to get his mind off his troubles. 
Dad, I'm sorry, I don't think he's ready to talk about it so we're not talking about it. 
Now listen. I know you're upset, but let's remember why you left Maris in the first place: you were tired of groveling. 
Yes. All it takes is stealth, cunning and a key to the door. 
Right...! Wait! What if Maris is out of pills? 
[chuckling] Oh, I see. 
Niles, this painting here in the living room, have you always had this? 
No, no, it must be a different painting. This is Maris next to a really big tree. 
In that case, I wouldn't look too closely at the face of that skunk in the flowerbed. 
How so? 
Oh, that candelabra? 
I think you owe us all a candelabra for that. 
If you choose you never have to see Maris again. 
Well, we had an argument one day. He called me a stuffed shirt and hung up on me. I was mad. 
[to Martin] You were dead! What did it matter? 
Oh my God... I slept with that woman three months ago. 
Yes! 
What the hell you do mean, you were about to get married? 
All right, all right, look, look, Sam, come, let's have a seat here and start this thing from the very beginning. Now, who is this woman? 
You know, Sam, it's always amazed me how you can elevate and demean in the same sentence. 
You know, for most guys that's just an expression. 
This is Roz Doyle. 
Oh, boy. Just look at the two of you face to face. I imagine wild animals all over the Northwest are lifting their heads, alerted to the scent. Good-bye, Roz. 
Yes, it glows in the dark. 
Well, of course he's flirting with her. He flirts with everybody. He can't help it, he's a sexual compulsive. But he's getting help for it in a support group. 
So, that's our show for today. Don't forget, Bob "Bulldog" Brisco is up next and... oh, yes. This is KACL Cash Call Week. $5,000 when you answer your phone with the phrase that pays. So when your phone rings, don't say "hello", say... 
Well, blow me down! No, no, no, no! Just, uh, say, uh, "KACL is the talk of the town." Talk of Seattle, whatever. Bye-bye. 
What's all this? 
Niles? 
Good. 
Niles, you are giving a woman money in order to obtain physical affection! We are talking the world's oldest profession. Granted, this is sort of the Walt Disney version, but still. It's wrong, and I insist you stop it. 
Snap out of it! What you were doing was completely dishonest. 
What does that mean? 
Oh, don't be ridiculous! Our two situations are totally different. 
Well, for one thing, you've been misleading a woman for your own selfish gain. 
Well, I'm not finished. She was also trusting you to tell the truth! 
Your woman is English! 
I know, I know. It's just going to take a little while to climb down off of this particular high horse. 
Well, I have. Believe me, after one page, I was yearning for the worldly cynicism of Barney the Dinosaur. 
Niles, will you please stop giggling? It's very distracting. 
I'm trying to recommend the book. Reading it doesn't help. 
As a matter of fact, yes. 
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want Niles to know who I'm dating? 
I would sooner attend a hoedown. 
Dad, when a man has no front teeth and stitches on his nose, I think it's safe to assume he's sensitive to criticism. 
Dad! Dad! I can't read my paper! Eddie keeps staring at me! 
I'm trying to! 
Thank you, Niles. You're a good brother and a credit to the psychiatric profession. 
The brown one. 
[pings timer] No sports. 
A couple of years, eh? 
Either that, or it'll seem like eternity. 
Niles, I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't read my book. I can't have my coffee. I can't have any peace in my own home. 
Well, I'd love to have a beer with you, Dad. 
Ah, yes, the Crane family specialty. Two fat-fried eggs, dripping with grease, swimming in fat, with thick pieces of bacon and mayonaise on a piece of white bread, no crust. I can practically hear my left ventricle slamming shut even as we speak. 
Where are the Thomasons? Why is that dog still here? 
Oh for God's sake, he works at the zoo! She's a nurse, Billy's an altar boy and Kathy is a Campfire Girl! 
They had a ten-acre farm! If they'd taken me, I'd have gone with them! 
You know Dad, I've just developed a very interesting theory about you... 
Slowly, over the years, your responsibilities have been taken away from you, and you, well, you feel symbolically castrated. 
Stop! Dogs only need names if you're going to call them to you, which we're not! 
Niles, you have liver behind your ears. 
You're saying you had a wad of cold meat behind your ears and you didn't feel it? 
Mrs. Greenway, there's no way Eddie could be the father - he's been neutered. 
Oh my God! They're miniature Eddies! 
[to Eddie] Bad dog! Look what you've done! 
For God sakes, don't love them! They'll think they're staying! 
[with the box of puppies] No, no we don't want them taking after their father. It may be too late already... 
Oh for God's sake, stop staring at me! 
You know, Niles, what say I buy us dinner and a lot of martinis? 
Bulldog, is there nothing I can say to appeal to your sense of decency? 
[to himself] Like a guy. Like a guy. 
SCREW HER! 
[angrily] Yeah, you don't need her. She's trash! 
You're better off without her; We both are! 
Yeah, so do I! Unattractive, yet liberating, rather like the one and only time I wore a European bathing suit. 
I'm sorry. SHE'S A BITCH! 
You're right. All she did was save you the trouble of having to dump her! 
There you go! 
That's right! 
[shaking his hand] Likewise. You know, I could talk like this for another thirty seconds. 
[walking back in the booth with Bulldog] She was nothing! She was less than nothing! Tomorrow you're gonna find someone even hotter and you know what you're gonna do? 
You're gonna have your fun with her and then you're gonna dump her just for the hell of it! 
And you know what? You're not gonna feel bad about it at all. You know why? Because we're GUYS and THAT'S WHAT GUYS DO!
